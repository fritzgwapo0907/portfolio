      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm currently a student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT).
        My journey in tech began with a curiosity for how websites and applications work behind the scenes,
        and that curiosity has grown into a deep interest in software development, web technologies, and
        building real-world solutions through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is a collection of some of the projects I’ve worked on so far. I'm excited to keep learning,
        building, and sharing my progress along the way.
