      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student with a growing passion for
        technology and software development. While I'm still early in my journey, I've been actively learning
        about various areas of IT including programming, web development, and basic networking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve spent time building small projects to improve my skills, especially in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        I'm also beginning to explore backend development and database management as I aim to become a well-rounded developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, participating in coding communities,
        and constantly challenging myself to learn and grow. My goal is to use what I learn to create meaningful,
        real-world solutions and eventually work in the tech industry after graduation.
